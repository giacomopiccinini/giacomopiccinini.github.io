Hey!

I am Giacomo, a Machine Learning engineer specialising in Vision and Audio. Currently, I am the CTO at [Gemmo AI](https://gemmo.ai/), a Dublin-based start-up that provides bespoke Deep Learning solutions. 

In a past life, I was a String Theorist at Swansea University in Wales, where I mastered the art of surviving the daily rain and efficiently drinking beer.

Here, Iâ€™ll share some formal aspects of Machine Learning that I find intriguing (most likely with random frequency). I am a firm believer that Machine Learning as a field requires more formality and fewer parameters.

Ping me on any social to discuss this further!
