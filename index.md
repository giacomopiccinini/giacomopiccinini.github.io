Hey!

I am Giacomo, a Machine Learning engineer specialising in Vision and Audio. Currently, I am the CTO at [Gemmo AI](https://gemmo.ai/), a Dublin-based start-up that provides bespoke Deep Learning solutions. 

In my previous life I was a String Theorist at Swansea University (Wales), where I learned how to survive daily rains and to efficiently drink beers. 

Here I will try and report (most likely with random cadence) some formal aspects of Machine Learning I find interesting. I am a firm believer that Machine Learning as a field requires much more formality and way less parameters.

Ping me on any social to discuss this further!
